## 🎯 Vision
I created this app for **YouTube creators to save time and boost engagement** by generating high-quality thumbnails that grab attention. Just point, click, and get thumbnails that **increase CTR and grow your channel**.

## ❓ Why Was This Made?
Creators know thumbnails are one of the most important factors in YouTube success. However:
- Many lack the design skills to make professional thumbnails.
- Hiring designers can be costly and time-consuming.
- Existing tools are either expensive or generic.

**This app solves all three problems by:**
- Providing a **fast, AI-powered solution**.
- Allowing creators to **customize via natural language prompts**.
- Delivering **multiple options at once** (9 thumbnails per generation).
